# README

This is my "Breakable Toy" project developed during my time at Launch Academy and maintained/updated thereafter.

Dogsta is a social media application for anyone interested in adopting a dog.

Dogsta also allows for businesses to create accounts and list pets for adoption through the site.

With Dogsta, users can create an account which will allow them to browse dogs that are currently available for adoption and actively chat with the shelter that listed them using Action Cable.
